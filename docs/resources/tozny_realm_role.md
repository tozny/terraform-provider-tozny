  api_endpoint = "http://platform.local.tozny.com:8000"
  account_username = "test+${random_string.account_username_salt.result}@tozny.com"
}

# Generate a random string for use in creating
# accounts across environments or executions conflict free
resource "random_string" "account_username_salt" {
  length = 8
