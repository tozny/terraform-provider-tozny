# tozny_realm_application_role Resource

Resource for provisioning a TozID Application Role for assigning permissions to an identity.

This resource requires that the account username and password be supplied to the provider either via explicit provider settings or file based credentials.

## Example Usage
```hcl
# Include the Tozny Terraform provider
provider "tozny" {
  api_endpoint = "http://platform.local.tozny.com:8000"
  account_username = "test+${random_string.account_username_salt.result}@tozny.com"
}

# Generate a random string for use in creating
# accounts across environments or executions conflict free
resource "random_string" "account_username_salt" {
  length = 8
  special = false
}

# Generate a random string for use in creating
# realms across environments or executions conflict free
resource "random_string" "random_realm_name" {
  length = 8
  special = false
}
