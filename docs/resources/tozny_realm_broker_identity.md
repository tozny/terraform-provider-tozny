# tozny_realm_broker_identity Resource

A resource for provisioning an Identity for brokering Realm activities such as email recovery.

This resource requires that the account username and password be supplied to the provider either via explicit provider settings or file based credentials.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Include the Tozny Terraform provider
provider "tozny" {
  api_endpoint = "http://platform.local.tozny.com:8000"
  account_username = "test+${random_string.account_username_salt.result}@tozny.com"
}

# Generate a random string for use in creating
# accounts across environments or executions conflict free
resource "random_string" "account_username_salt" {
  length = 8
  special = false
}

# Generate a random string for use in creating
# realms across environments or executions conflict free
resource "random_string" "random_realm_name" {
  length = 8
  special = false
}

# Local variables for defining where to store and find local Tozny client credentials
locals {
  tozny_client_credentials_filepath = "./tozny_client_credentials.json"
}

# A resource for provisioning a Tozny account using Terraform generated
# credentials that are saved to user specified filepath for reuse upon success.
resource "tozny_account" "autogenerated_tozny_account" {
  autogenerate_account_credentials = true
  client_credentials_save_filepath = local.tozny_client_credentials_filepath
}

# A resource for provisioning a TozID Realm
# using local file based credentials for a Tozny Client with permissions to manage Realms.
resource "tozny_realm" "my_organizations_realm" {
  # Block on and use client credentials generated from the provisioned account
  depends_on = [
    tozny_account.autogenerated_tozny_account,
  ]
  client_credentials_filepath = local.tozny_client_credentials_filepath
  realm_name = random_string.random_realm_name.result
  sovereign_name = "Administrator"
}

# A resource for provisioning a token that can be used to register Tozny clients
# such as a realm broker identity
resource "tozny_client_registration_token" "realm_registration_token" {
  # Block on and use client credentials generated from the provisioned account
  depends_on = [
    tozny_account.autogenerated_tozny_account,
  ]
  client_credentials_filepath = local.tozny_client_credentials_filepath
  name = "${tozny_realm.my_organizations_realm.realm_name}DefaultClientRegistrationToken"
  allowed_registration_client_types = ["general", "identity", "broker"]
  enabled = true
  one_time_use = false
}

# A resource for provisioning an identity that can be used to delegate authority for
# realm activities such as email recovery
resource "tozny_realm_broker_identity" "broker_identity" {
  # Block on and use client credentials generated from the provisioned account
  depends_on = [
    tozny_account.autogenerated_tozny_account,
  ]
  client_credentials_filepath = local.tozny_client_credentials_filepath
  client_registration_token = tozny_client_registration_token.realm_registration_token.token
  realm_name = tozny_realm.my_organizations_realm.realm_name
  name = "broker${tozny_realm.my_organizations_realm.realm_name}"
  broker_identity_credentials_save_filepath = "./${tozny_realm.my_organizations_realm.realm_name}_broker_identity_credentials.json"
}
```
