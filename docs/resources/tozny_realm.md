# tozny_realm Resource

Resource for provisioning a TozID Realm, the primary top level resource for all other resources provided by TozID (e.g. Identities, Groups, Roles & Applications).

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Include the Tozny Terraform provider
provider "tozny" {
  api_endpoint = "https://dev.e3db.com"
  account_username = "test-emails-group+${random_string.account_username_salt.result}@tozny.com"
}

# Generate a random string for use in creating
# accounts across environments or executions conflict free
resource "random_string" "account_username_salt" {
  length = 8
  special = false
}

# Generate a random string for use in creating
# realms across environments or executions conflict free
resource "random_string" "random_realm_name" {
  length = 8
  special = false
}

# Local variables for defining where to store and find local Tozny client credentials
locals {
  tozny_client_credentials_filepath = "./tozny_client_credentials.json"

# A resource for provisioning a Tozny account using Terraform generated
# credentials that are saved to user specified filepath for reuse upon success.

  broker_identity_credentials_save_filepath = "./${tozny_realm.my_organizations_realm.realm_name}_broker_identity_credentials.json"
}

# A resource for delegating authority to another Tozny client
# (either hosted by Tozny or some other third party) to broker realm
# activities (such as email recovery).
