# tozny_realm Resource

Resource for provisioning a TozID Realm, the primary top level resource for all other resources provided by TozID (e.g. Identities, Groups, Roles & Applications).

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Include the Tozny Terraform provider
provider "tozny" {
  api_endpoint = "https://dev.e3db.com"
  account_username = "test-emails-group+${random_string.account_username_salt.result}@tozny.com"
}

# Generate a random string for use in creating
# accounts across environments or executions conflict free
resource "random_string" "account_username_salt" {
  length = 8
  special = false
}

# Generate a random string for use in creating
# realms across environments or executions conflict free
resource "random_string" "random_realm_name" {
  length = 8
  special = false
}

# Local variables for defining where to store and find local Tozny client credentials
locals {
