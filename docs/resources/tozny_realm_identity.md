# tozny_realm_identity Resource

Resource to manage an identity for a TozID Realm. Useful for supporting service users.

This resource requires that the account username and password be supplied to the provider either via explicit provider settings or file based credentials.

This resource currently only supports supplying a password for the user. This is saved to terraform state for use in other modules. The intent is this resource creates service
users which are embedded in other providers and resources. You are also able to update an identities password using the resource. At this time, it is not suggested to create identities for end users with this resource.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Include the Tozny Terraform provider
provider "tozny" {
  api_endpoint = "http://platform.local.tozny.com:8000"
  account_username = "test+${random_string.account_username_salt.result}@tozny.com"
}

# Generate a random string for use in creating
# accounts across environments or executions conflict free
resource "random_string" "account_username_salt" {
  length = 8
  special = false
}

# Generate a random string for use in creating
# realms across environments or executions conflict free
resource "random_string" "random_realm_name" {
  length = 8
  special = false
}

}

# A resource for provisioning a TozID identity to embed into another resource.
# Note this user specifies a password -- protect this sensitive information
# by ensuring state files are encrypted

- `username - (Required) The username for this identity.
- `email - (Required) The email address associated with this identity.
- `client_registration_token - (Required) A registration token for the realm allowed to create identities.
- `broker_target_url - (Required) The base link for password resets.
- `password - (Required) The password for this identity. Ideally this comes from a secret store of some kind.
