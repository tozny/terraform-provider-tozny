# tozny_realm_broker_delegation Resource

A resource for delegating authority to another Tozny client (either hosted by Tozny or some other third party) to broker realm activities (such as email recovery).

This resource requires that the account username and password be supplied to the provider either via explicit provider settings or file based credentials.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Include the Tozny Terraform provider
provider "tozny" {
  api_endpoint = "http://platform.local.tozny.com:8000"
  account_username = "test+${random_string.account_username_salt.result}@tozny.com"
}

# Generate a random string for use in creating
# accounts across environments or executions conflict free
resource "random_string" "account_username_salt" {
  length = 8
  special = false
}

# Generate a random string for use in creating
# realms across environments or executions conflict free
resource "random_string" "random_realm_name" {
  length = 8
  special = false
}

# Local variables for defining where to store and find local Tozny client credentials
locals {
  tozny_client_credentials_filepath = "./tozny_client_credentials.json"
}

# A resource for provisioning a Tozny account using Terraform generated
# credentials that are saved to user specified filepath for reuse upon success.
resource "tozny_account" "autogenerated_tozny_account" {
  autogenerate_account_credentials = true
  client_credentials_save_filepath = local.tozny_client_credentials_filepath
}

# A resource for provisioning a TozID Realm
# using local file based credentials for a Tozny Client with permissions to manage Realms.

  depends_on = [
    tozny_account.autogenerated_tozny_account,
  ]
  client_credentials_filepath = local.tozny_client_credentials_filepath
  realm_name = random_string.random_realm_name.result
  sovereign_name = "Administrator"
}

# A resource for provisioning a token that can be used to register Tozny clients
# such as a realm broker identity

  name = "${tozny_realm.my_organizations_realm.realm_name}DefaultClientRegistrationToken"
  allowed_registration_client_types = ["general", "identity", "broker"]
  enabled = true
  one_time_use = false
}

# A resource for provisioning an identity that can be used to delegate authority for
# realm activities such as email recovery

  realm_name = tozny_realm.my_organizations_realm.realm_name
  name = "broker${tozny_realm.my_organizations_realm.realm_name}"
  broker_identity_credentials_save_filepath = "./${tozny_realm.my_organizations_realm.realm_name}_broker_identity_credentials.json"
}

# A resource for delegating authority to another Tozny client
# (either hosted by Tozny or some other third party) to broker realm
# activities (such as email recovery).
resource "tozny_realm_broker_delegation" "allow_tozny_hosted_brokering_policy" {
  # Block on and use client credentials generated from the provisioned account
  depends_on = [
    tozny_account.autogenerated_tozny_account,
    tozny_realm_broker_identity.broker_identity,
  ]
  client_credentials_filepath = local.tozny_client_credentials_filepath

## Argument Reference

### Top-Level Arguments

* `realm_broker_identity_credentials_filepath` - (Required) The filepath to load the realm broker identity to delegate access to.
* `use_tozny_hosted_broker` - (Optional) Whether to delegate realm brokering to the Tozny Hosted Broker. Defaults to true.
* `client_id_to_delegate_brokering` - (Required) Client ID to delegate realm brokering to.
* `delegated_broker_client_id` - (Computed) The ID of the client realm brokering is delegated to.
* `client_credentials_filepath` - (Optional) The filepath to Tozny client credentials for the provider to use when provisioning this resource. For this resource either this value or both `account_username` and `account_password` must be set on the provider. Omit if using `client_credentials_config`.
* `client_credentials_config` - (Optional) A JSON string containing Tozny client credentials for the provider to use when provisioning this resource. For this resource either this value or both `account_username` and `account_password` must be set on the provider. Omit if using `client_credentials_filepath`.
* `broker_token_record_id` - (Computed) ID of the  TozStore record containing material to derive the realm broker identity credentials.
