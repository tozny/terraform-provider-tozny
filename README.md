# terraform-provider-tozny

Tozny Terraform provider for Infrastructure As Code (IAC) automation of Tozny products.

## Use

In general to use the Tozny Terraform provider you have to create a Terraform file or module that imports the plugin:

```hcl main.tf
# Configure the Terraform runtime
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 0.13"
  required_providers {
    tozny = {
      # Pull signed provider binaries from
      # the Terraform hosted registry namespace
      # for Tozny registry.terraform.io/tozny
      source  = "tozny/tozny"
      # Pin Tozny provider version
      version = ">=0.10.1"
    }
  }
}

# Include the Tozny Terraform provider
provider "tozny" {
  api_endpoint = "https://api.e3db.com"
  account_username = "test@example.com"
  account_password = "readymyenvironmentplease"
}
```

Note that you can specify configuration such as the account username and password, and or client credentials via environment variables (`TOZNY_ACCOUNT_USERNAME`, `TOZNY_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD`, `TOZNY_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS_FILEPATH`)as well as explicitly in the Terraform provider configuration block

```hcl main.tf
# Include the Tozny Terraform provider for this module
provider "tozny" {
  api_endpoint = "https://api.e3db.com"
  account_username = "test@example.com"
  account_password = "readymyenvironmentplease"
}
```

Once the provider is incorporated into your Terraform module and appropriate provider configuration provided, you can then specify a Tozny resource to provision


```
# A resource for provisioning a Tozny account using Terraform generated
# credentials that are saved to user specified filepath for reuse upon success.
resource "tozny_account" "autogenerated_tozny_account" {
  autogenerate_account_credentials = true
  client_credentials_save_filepath = "./tozny_client_credentials.json"
}
```

execute the Terraform program on the schema

```bash
ValleyOfTheForge:account octo$ terraform init

Partner and community providers are signed by their developers.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
ValleyOfTheForge:account octo$
```

```bash
ValleyOfTheForge:account octo$ terraform plan
Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # random_string.account_username_salt will be created
  + resource "random_string" "account_username_salt" {
      + id          = (known after apply)
      + length      = 8
      + lower       = true
      + min_lower   = 0
      + min_numeric = 0
      + min_special = 0
      + min_upper   = 0
      + number      = true
      + result      = (known after apply)
      + special     = false
      + upper       = true
    }

  # tozny_account.autogenerated_tozny_account will be created
  + resource "tozny_account" "autogenerated_tozny_account" {
      + autogenerate_account_credentials  = true
      + client_credentials_save_filepath  = "./tozny_client_credentials.json"
      + id                                = (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
"terraform apply" is subsequently run.

ValleyOfTheForge:account octo$
```

```bash
ValleyOfTheForge:account octo$ terraform apply

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:

    }

}
ValleyOfTheForge:account octo$
```

and you are now free to move your data around privately and securely with Tozny's trusted products!

🛫

More pertinently, you can use the `account_user_name` and `account_password` in the credentials file to log into the Tozny Dashboard, and the remaining config to initialize Tozny SDKs or [CLI](github.com/tozny/e3db-go) (example of CLI workflow below).

```bash
ValleyOfTheForge:account octo$ cp tozny_client_credentials.json ~/.tozny/e3db.json
ValleyOfTheForge:account octo$ e3db lsrealms
24 http://localhost:8000/auth/admin/DocumentersGotToDocument/console
ValleyOfTheForge:account octo$ e3db lsrealms
24 http://localhost:8000/auth/admin/DocumentersGotToDocument/console
```

### General Setup

[Doc](docs/index.md)

### Creating An Account

[Doc](docs/create_an_account.md)

## Development


### Pre-requisites

* go 1.14+
* terrraform 0.13+

### Building & testing locally

```bash
make lint
```

Build the provider and make it available for local invocations of the `terraform` program

```bash
make install
```

If developing on a macOS x86 environment instead run


```bash
make install-mac
```

Update any Terraform resources or modules to use the locally built version of the Tozny provider

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 0.13"
  required_providers {
    tozny = {
      source  = "terraform.tozny.com/tozny/tozny"
    }
  }
}
```

and if debugging update the [debug parameters](./main.go) to map to the local namespace

```go
err := plugin.Debug(context.Background(), "terraform.tozny.com/tozny/tozny",
      &plugin.ServeOpts{
        ProviderFunc: tozny.Provider,
      })
```

To remove previously built binaries of this provider run

```bash
make clean
```

or on a macOS x86 environment instead run

```bash
make clean-mac
```

## Publish

### Prerequisites

* Sign up for an account with [Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io)

* [Connect to Tozny's github organization](https://registry.terraform.io/publish/provider)

* [Generate GPG keys](https://support.yubico.com/support/solutions/articles/15000006420-using-your-yubikey-with-openpgp#Generating_Keys_externally_from_the_YubiKey_(Recommended)4sn2r) and [provide public GPG key to Terraform over email](https://www.terraform.io/guides/terraform-provider-development-program.html#3-verify) to use in signing and verifying distribution binaries

* [Install goreleaser](https://goreleaser.com/install/) if doing local based release artifact creation.

* Github [personal action token(https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with `public_repo` scope if doing local based release artifact creation

### Documentation

When publishing new releases, be sure to add, update, delete and [verify](https://registry.terraform.io/tools/doc-preview) the [documentation for the provider](./docs).

### Tagging

Tag and update the provider & repository version number following [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org).

```bash
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

### Local Release Artifact Creation

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=*************
export GPG_FINGERPRINT=**********
```

Build binaries of the provider for all common platforms and architectures:

```bash
make release
```

### Remote Release Artifact Creation

On every push that involves a new tag of matching the regular expression `[v.*]` binaries are built from the source code associated with that tag as part of the [configured github actions](.github/workflows) for this repository.
